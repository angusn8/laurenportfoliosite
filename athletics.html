                <p>I have been swimming competitively for 10 years, so it is a significant part of who I am. It has guided me through so
                many stressors in my life, helped me become more focused and motivated outside of the pool. I am always at my best when
                I am swimming. It has constantly challenged me, but it has pushed me to be much stronger than I ever thought I could be.
                I can truthfully say that my life would be completely different without the impact of my team, and the sport itself.
                Swimming has helped mold me into the person I am today.</p>

        <div class="accolades-text">
            <p>In swimming, I earned a letter in all 3 seasons (and counting) of high school. I received the High Point award for most
            points scored on my team in my sophomore and junior year. I was a WPIAL qualifier in the 50 Freestyle, 200 Medley Relay,
            200 Free Relay, and 400 Free Relay my freshman year. Our 200 Freestyle Relay tied for 8th at theWPIAL Championships, so
            I got to take home a medal. </p>
            <p>Sophomore year, I qualified in the 50 Freestyle, 100 Breaststroke, 200 Medley Relay, and 200
            Free Relay. That year, we placed 7th in the 200 Freestyle Relay. I qualified for the same events in my junior season.
            This year, I am a senior captain. In Volleyball, I lettered my junior and senior year on the varsity team. I was a Captain my senior year, and made Third
            Team WPIAL All Section 5 AA.</p>

            <div class="underline"></div>
            <p>I started playing volleyball when I joined my middle school team in 7th grade. The fast- thinking, high energy sport was
            a new pace that I had really enjoyed. I decided to keep playing, and move on to my high school team. It was a completely
            different game at that level, and our team improved very quickly beginning in high school. Throughout those 6 years, I had
            grown to love the sport. It taught me about the value of a team, and how your success depends on the success of the
            team. Volleyball remains a nostalgic memory of being with my friends, and working towards a goal together.</p>
