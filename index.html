            <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
            <div class="underline"></div>
            <p>I am a senior at Derry Area High School who is eager to begin the next phase of my academic career. After much
            contemplation, I have decided to pursue my passion for the human mind and mental health by majoring in Psychology. I am
            fascinated with the concept of individuality. I often find myself wondering why people develop so differently, when we
            are so genetically similar. Furthermore, it astounds me that people who have contrasting personalities can coexist, or
            even have successful relationships. Thinking about this concept allows my mind to wonder and be truly amazed.</p>
            <p>I also think that it is remarkable how any ordinary person's mind goes through an extreme amount of functioning and
            development every day. This ranges from split decisions, such as choosing to take another bite of a sandwich, to forming
            an emotional connection with another person. I used to overlook these occurrences and label them as ordinary. Now I
            can't view the human mind anything but extraordinary, and am constantly wanting to learn more about it. I have never
            wanted to learn more about something as much as I do regarding psychology. It fills me with the passion to learn that I
            can't experience while doing a math problem or studying history.</p>
            <p>Another passion driving me towards psychology is my belief in the importance of mental health. I deeply believe that
                having a healthy mind is the most crucial component to having a healthy body. Consequently, whether a person suffers
                from a mental illness, or is just going through a stressful time, they could benefit greatly from the help of a
                counseling psychologist. I would love to be someone who can impact another's life in this way.
            
            
                Because of my passion for psychology, I am happy to say that studying it at Robert Morris University would be a
                fantastic investment in my future, as well as a great opportunity to have an inspiring college experience.</p>

                <p>Leadership</p>
                <p>Due to my creative thinking and individuality, I take on a leadership role in group settings. A special skill that I
                bring to the table is the ability to see an end goal, and devise a plan to achieve it. I am able to recognize the
                attributes of the people I am working with to help the team reach its fullest potential.</p>

            <div class="skill">

                <p>I am a great communicator in all of my endeavors, and I constantly work to improve on this natural attribute. I believe
                that building on my communication skills will be a key component to my future success.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <p>Critical Thinking</p>
                <p>I am strong in the area of critical thinking because of my persistent drive to find a solution to the problem. I
                genuinely enjoy the process of problem solving; therefore, I excel when I am put into a situation where I need to “dig
                deep” and think intellectually.</p>
