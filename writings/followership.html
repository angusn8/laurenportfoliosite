        <h1>Effective Followership</h1>
    </section>

    <div class="individual-writing">
        <p>In order to be a successful group, there must be a solid dynamic of leaders and followers. Typically, the group is
        judged by the effectiveness of their leaders. However, a leader would be nothing without their dependable collection of
        followers. Therefore, we must also take into account the effectiveness of the followers to determine the strength of the
        group. To be an effective follower is to not only be an active member of the union established by the leader, but to
        question the effectiveness of the leader when necessary. A leader who is immune to criticism is often corrupt, and in
        reality, much further from perfection than one who is challenged in a formal manner. The responsibility of maintaining
        the leader’s effectiveness is held by only the most effective followers.</p>
        <p>When people blindly follow the leader and provide unconditional support, the leader then has free reign to take
        advantage of their people and act poorly. This is not to say that followers shouldn’t be supportive, but to highlight
        the idea that they can be supportive while still giving constructive criticism when their leader has made a mistake, or
        is not performing to the best of their abilities. This idea has been proven to be an essential way to maintain a strong
        union in even the largest groups of people. It is used to weed out dictators in various countries, and is even written
        in their historical documents to ensure that it is not lost. America's founding fathers themselves knew the importance
        of effective followership when they included several opportunities to question and evolve the government in the
        constitution. In the first amendment, they specifically protected the freedom to petition the government. They also
        allowed for the freedom of speech and press, and consequently, people now have the ability to speak out on the success
        or failure of our government. Much too often, these freedoms are abused by people who are ill-intended, or ineffective
        in the way they present their opinion. However, the freedoms must remain for the sake of the other followers who are
        trying to instill positive change, and for the nation to be enduring and strong. Effective followership is utilizing
        these opportunities in an intelligent manner for the common good of the group.</p>
        <p>Effective followership can also mean to be an active supporter, instead of a silent one. A leader always needs more
        people to help get their ideas spread and accepted among the group. Active supporters can relate to the other followers
        and act as a connection between the leadership and followership. This encourages the followers to carry out the leaders
        policies, and be productive in their work. Being productive is how the silent followers can be effective. Active
        followers are great communicators, and are an essential element of the leader- follower dynamic. Because they step up
        when needed, they can also be considered leaders in a way. Without them, the leaders would not know how they are
        perceived within the group, and the silent followers would have difficulty communicating how they are being led. It
        would also be difficult for the other followers to do their job if the leaders' policies were ineffective, which is
        where the active followers come in to communicate. All followers are equally important, but those who speak up are a
        group to be recognized.They are star players, and the team would be much less effective without them.</p>
        <p>Sometimes followers feel that their role isn’t important because they are not in charge. This is indefinitely wrong, as
        they have strength in numbers, as well as important roles to play. It is known that if the leadership is ineffective,
        the group suffers. The same is true for all types of followers. If they do not contribute to the well being of the group
        by doing their part, no matter how big or small, it will be weaker because of it. This makes effective followership just
        as important as effective leadership.</p>
