        <p><strong>What Was the Major Impact of Psychoanalysis?</strong></p>
        <p>In the early 1880’s, Dr. Josepsh Breur of Vienna, Austria was treating a woman with severe hysteria. He found that her
        symptoms were connected with disturbing events that she experienced in the past while nursing her dying father. He used
        hypnosis to induce her to recall and act out her forgotten experiences, so that her symptoms dissapeared- a process
        known as the “Cathatic Method.” Although this was the catalyst to the study of psychoanalysis, a method of treating
        mental disorders, Dr. Sigmaund Freud found that the cures from the Cathartic Method weren’t permanant. So, he replaced
        this method with “Free Association.” As Freud and Breur published many cases, they developed a plethora of methods under
        the catagory of psychoanalysis. Most of these methods would take many sessions throughout many years to work
        effectively. There are numerous methods that were, and still are used. But, they all had the same goal. This was to
        bring unconscious material into consciousness and enhance the functioning of the ego, helping each individual become
        less controlled by biological drives or demands of the superego. In other words, patients became clensed of their
        unconscious tramas.</p>
        <p><strong>How Will Psychoanlysis be Used in the Future?</strong></p>
        <p>Psychoanalysis is on a major decline. Though many new versions of Freud's are being modernized and used, the field is
        still dying. The true psychoanalysis developed during the Industrial Revolution is now irrelevant, and the future will
        most likely have even less psychoanalysis usage. replaced with many new message in theories. A highly popular form of
        therapy is Cognitive-Based therapy. This is relating more to solving the current issues with the patient to improve
        cognitive abilities and functioning. This type of therapy is preferred by many, mainly because it doesn't take as many
        years as psychoanalysis to be put into effect. It also doesn't involve bringing back painful experiences of the past.
        Thus, although psychoanalysis is good in theory, and sometimes in result, most patients do not want to go through the
        long and painful process. Furthermore, if psychoanalysis keeps its same pattern and is not saved by psychologiststs, it
        will continue on its decline.</p>
        <p><strong>What is the Modern Day Impact of Psychoanalysis?</strong></p>
        <p>Today, psychoanalysis is one of the most controversial approaches to psychotherapy. the movement has slowed drastically,
        but many new and modified methods of Freud's are still considered valid. Albiet it isn’t a highly popular concept, it is
        still being studied and debated over. Ink Blot, Free Association, Dream Analysis, Resistance Analysis, Transference
        Analysis, and the Freudian Slip are the accepted approaches that have been developed up until this point in time. While
        these approaches are not very common and have been mostly replaced with methods like Cognitive-Based Therapy (CBT),
        there are still many researches that consider them to be highly effective. One paper found that long-term psychodynamic
        psychotherapy (LTPP) is more effective than less intensive forms of psychotherapy in treating complex mental disorders.
        Another found that, on a larger scale, LTPP had a much higher rate of effectiveness targeting problems and general
        personality functioning than shorter forms of psychotherapy. Furthermore, it was said to have a more positive impact
        than other modern healthcare therapies, with improvement continuing after treatment. Another study concluded that the
        benefits of short-term psychodynamic therapies are equivalent to those acquired from antidepressants and CBT. Lastly,
        and a study on panic disorder, 49 adults with panic disorder were given either psychodynamic treatment or relaxation
        training. Those given the treatment showed a significantly greater reduction of panic symptoms than those who received
        relaxation training, and even great improvement in psychosocial functioning. This shows the large impact psychoanalysis
        has had on the modern world, though it may seem to be an outdated concept.</p>
        <p><strong>Why am I Interested in Psychoanalysis?</strong></p>
        <p>I am very interested in the field of psychology, and always want to learn about it and its effects on society. This
        particular subject is highly intriguing because it has different ideas about how to treat patients. I still believe that
        it is a great concept and has more benefits than downsides. Though it is declining, it has been relevant since the
        Industrial Revolution. It does have some potential to be built up and modernized to fit the current mental healthcare
        demands of this century. Mental health is finally being recognized and credited with its importance in this day and age.
        People are realizing that it is just as important for your mind to be healthy as it is for the rest of your body, so it
        is important to be educated on the basis of psychology. With the overall relevance today, and my own personal interest,
        I found it highly important to learn about psychoanalysis.</p>
