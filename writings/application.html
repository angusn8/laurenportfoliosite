        If you could give one piece of advice to incoming high school students what would it be?</p>
        <p>It is fair to say that I was truely my toughest critic growing up and starting high
        school. My mom was always tough on me to always try my hardest on absolutely
        everything that I did. She implemented the mindset in me that I shouldn’t make excuses
        for myself and to take responsibility for my actions. I’ll be honest, a lot of my success is
        due to that mindset.</p>
        <p>However, as I became more accountable for myself and more independent, it
        became really hard to hear how great I need to be from everyone. The school has a job to
        make kids accountable for themselves and push them, so that was another place keeping
        me in line. Here’s where I stood: I had the school, my parents, and mostly myself telling
        me how good I should be. At times, that was more pressure than I could handle. After
        my first year of high school, I got lazier than I ever had been because I had grown tired
        of it. I couldn’t worry or stress myself out like I did in the past. I was mentally
        exhausted, and that affected my attitude. Granted, part of that exhaustion came from
        learning how to juggle volleyball, swimming, choir, ensemble, musical, and being class
        secretary. That year, I still did very well in school, but I knew that I could do better.</p>
        <p>If I could give an incoming high school student similar to me one piece of advice,
        I would tell them a simple “you’re doing okay, it’s going to be okay.” For motivated high
        school students, reassurance is the best thing you can give them. I’d be the person for
        them who’d be by their side to let them know that they’re doing just fine. I’d give them
        the confidence they didn’t know they would need to get through high school. Most of my
        struggles academically, socially, personally, and athletically in school have been due to
        self-doubt, uncertainty, and lack of confidence in myself. This is something that I see
        common with a lot of students that isn’t discussed enough. The underlying pressure that
        causes us to doubt ourselves is one of the main roadblocks in high school. Between
        figuring out what our new found high school personalities are, keeping up with our
        social lives amongst high school drama, deciding what’s next after high school when we
        have to abruptly mature into adults, and maintaining good grades, our minds become
        choatic. This is something I personally relate to a lot, being a person with a very active
        mind and a filled schedule.</p>
        <p>It took me a while to figure it out, but now I am equipped with the balance I need
        to take on my ambitions. I couldn’t imagine not being a part of many activities and still
        striving to be my best. So to keep up with the life that I imagine for myself, I will
        continue to improve my time management and maintain a balanced lifestyle. I also will
        remind myself that I can do these things in moments of self-doubt.</p>
