        <p>Can you think of her for one minute? <br>
        Is that minute that it takes to make the decision to rape her or not to <br>
        rape her <br>
        just too much for you ? <br>
        You need it, <br>
        right? <br>
        You need it that bad that she has to sacrifice <br>
        her body <br>
        for one night. <br>
        Except after that night, <br>
        you find another one <br>
        and she still has to live with it. <br>
        She has to go through her one life, <br>
        Her one life, <br>
        forever remembering being forced, frightened, afraid, forming the <br>
        thought that her “frail” body, “frivolous” needs aren’t half as important <br>
        as yours, <br>
        Facing the fact that she’s affected by you, <br>
        told her story’s fake. <br>
        Her fundamental freaking right to fight <br>
        Her true basic right to her own self is taken tragically. <br>
        Then so too is her just right of equality <br>
        that she trusted you with for that minute, <br>
        truly, terrifyingly, <br>
        for one minute. <br>
        
        Then it’s her fault. <br>
        Her fault <br>
        that you did take advantage of her. <br>
        And you did, <br>
        downright abused and detained her, defenseless. <br>
        
        All dignity disappeared. <br>
        All because you saw a little skin. <br>
        All because she was walking down a dark alley. <br>
        All because she flirted. <br>
        All because she kissed you for what, one minute? <br>
        All because she was asking for it. <br>
        She asked to be raped, <br>
        you claim. <br> 
        Think about that. <br>
        Think about that for one minute. <br>
        She asked <br>
        to be held against her will, to be ashamed, to be disrespected and <br>
        oppressed. <br>
        She asked, yet no one heard anything <br>
        You didn’t hear anything, the police didn’t hear anything, and the judge <br>
        didn’t hear anything. <br>
        But they all act as if they did, still <br>
        Because you said she did, they believe you. <br>
        Because you’re a man <br>
        You’re strong, smart, stable <br>
        Because you’re a man <br>
        And you just rape her because you can <br>
        because you’re a man <br>
        you decide the rules, ours, yours, it’s all about you. <br>
        Because she’s just a women. <br>
        Incase you didn’t realize, that makes her human being. <br>
        Listen to her call <br>
        Hear her saying no <br>
        See the look in her eyes, the tears on her face. <br>
        Feel her emotions like they’re your own, <br>
        
        because the fault was your own. <br>
        Wait for the consent. <br>
        “permission for something to happen or agreement to do something” <br>
        That is consent. <br>
        That’s what it means. <br>
        learn it. <br>
        Take one minute to understand. <br>
        Take as many minutes as a man might need to make sense of its <br>
        meaning. <br>
        Live by it, or live with the sentence. <br>
        Think of us, <br>
        think of her, <br>
        for one minute.</p>
