    <div class="individual-writing">
        <p>Humans have busy lives that are difficult to keep up with; we often get consumed with our own, and forget to discover
        what is happening with someone else's. We’re so accustomed to our own culture that we don’t realize when there is
        someone nearby that is living a completely different life. I enjoy learning about different cultures, but I am guilty of
        this as well. Recently, I read a book called Dreaming in Indian, and had the opportunity to learn about Indigenous
        People. This collection of stories, poems, and artwork by Natives gave me a deeper understanding of their culture than
        what we are taught in history class</p>
        <p>Reading Dreaming in Indian was a different experience than any other time I’d learned about Indigenous People. Most
        things I’d seen before portrayed them as they were in the 1500s. While there are still many Natives who live a similar
        lifestyle to their ancestors, there are so many untold stories about modern natives. Countless Indigenous people dress
        similar to other Americans, have the same jobs, and live very similar lives overall. Furthermore, a majority do so while
        still celebrating their culture and deep history. Learning about the different ways that they preserve Native culture
        and deal with discrimination gave me a completely new perspective.</p>
        <p>Reading the stories about the frequent intolerance they receive from other Americans truly saddens me, and makes me
        wonder what else I don’t know about that is a big part of someone’s experiences. I wish that I had been taught how to
        make Indigenous People feel more comfortable in their own home. For example, while we are taught to use “Native
        American” over “Indian,” one thing I learned is that many of them actually prefer to be called “Indigenous Peoples” or
        “Natives” over “Native American.” This is a simple example of a way to respect Natives, but is the least of the
        intolerance that they face. Sometimes, it is from hateful people that are simply disrespectful towards their way of
        life. But too often, the discrimination and disrespect towards Indigenous Peoples is a result of miseducation and
        harmful stereotypes.
        </p>
        <p>Not only did Dreaming in Indian provide me with information on the modern culture of Natives, it also changed my
        perspective on how our society becomes isolated. Though it might be human nature, people overlook things that don’t
        directly affect them too frequently. This causes groups of people to become isolated from one another, and furthermore,
        creates an environment of prejudice. Then, prejudice becomes hate and tears society apart. This concept can become
        complex, but in my mind, one thing has become very clear. A great deal of the destruction of society can be rebuilt by
        people who are willing to take the time to learn about what they don’t know for certain.</p>
