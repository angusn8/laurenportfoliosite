        <h1>Get Comfortable with Being Uncomfortable</h1>
    </section>

    <div class="individual-writing">
        <p>The phrase “get comfortable with being uncomfortable” has caused so much personal growth and success for me. Being
        comfortable is what I naturally cling to, my body is designed that way. But, being too comfortable leads to complacency.
        In the long run, it only hurts me. Reflecting on all of my success, none of it happened when I was comfortable.</p>
        <p>Being on a swim team has emphasized the importance of this phrase. During practice, I often wanted to give up to make my
        body more comfortable. To keep working hard, I had to remind myself that pain is what makes me stronger. If I skipped
        steps or quit, I wouldn’t have improved or met my goals. Quitting is comfortable because it is easy, and relieves pain
        from whatever hardship I am facing. But, getting too comfortable with quitting only makes it happen more often. When
        quitting is second nature, it becomes increasingly harder to persist and make progress. Thus, I had to learn to be
        “comfortable with being uncomfortable” in order to thrive during the most difficult parts of practice.
        </p>
        <p>This idea has also helped me do well in school. Most students are not comfortable raising their hand in class, asking
        for extra help, or presenting their ideas to the class. However, all of these simple tasks help improve the quality of
        the education we receive. When I became more comfortable asking for help, I started understanding concepts sufficiently.
        The more I push myself to speak up in class and present my ideas, the better skill set I develop that will help me to be
        successful in a job one day. Becoming comfortable with uncomfortable tasks has made me a better student, and prepared me
        for future challenges in education.</p>
        <p>Avoiding complacency has opened my eyes to further possibilities of what I can accomplish. I know that being too
        comfortable will make my success stagnant, rather than allow it to increase. In order to discover my best self and all
        that I am capable of, I must be uncomfortable from time to time. No one has gotten anywhere great by being fine with
        being average. To be extraordinary, I have to recognize the danger that being comfortable 100% of the time brings: not
        performing to my fullest abilities and allowing my potential to stray. The statement “get comfortable with being
        uncomfortable” has helped me understand why people do things so often that they don’t necessarily enjoy doing in the
        moment: to stay on the road to success, and become the person who is satisfied with who they are.</p>
