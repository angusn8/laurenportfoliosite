    <div class="individual-writing">
        <p>Fear is one of the strongest emotions in people. It is full of immense ambiguity that
        forces them to act a certain way. As far as acting out on on it, fear “either cripples or motivates”
        us, Julie Elman says in an article on Yes Magazine. Most of these fears pertain to the future, as in
        something someone is scared to have happen to them or someone else. I have a fear of people
        abusing guns and how that has constituted a problem in this country and how it could be a
        problem to me eventually.</p>
        <p>Gun control has been a big issue in the U.S.A for a long time, but worries about it have
        escalated heavily in the past decade. Many people want to own more guns to feel protected and
        safe in their homes, so it is relatively easy to purchase and own a gun if you aren’t a convicted
        felon. While distributing guns to civilians for self defense could be an appropriate solution to
        attacks from dangerous gun holders, too many of the gun holders aren’t using them for self
        defense, and are the attackers themselves. The fact is, guns are moreso used for crimes than self
        defense, and when there is an attack, few people actually have a gun to defend themselves with.
        So for the large amount of guns in the us, specifically 120.5 guns per 100 people, or roughly
        393,347,000 guns, more of them must be being used for crime then self defense. According to
        procon.org:
        <br>
        In 2010 there were 230 "justifiable homicides" in which a private citizen used a
        firearm to kill a felon, compared to 8,275 criminal gun homicides (or, 36 criminal
        homicides for every "justifiable homicide"). Of the 84,495,500 property crimes
        <br>
        committed between 2007 and 2011, 0.12% of victims (103,000) protected
        themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm.”</p>
        <p>But, as these situations are frightening, we must consider the “fight or flee” response that
        comes into play when a fear is encountered, the fear in this case being the attack. On the flip
        side, there is a chance that some of the people that don’t use a gun for self-defense in a property
        attack are simply scared to and choose a flee response rather than a fight response. Rachael
        Sharman claims, “Despite the largely unconscious triggering of the threat response, as well as the
        personality types that influence your inherent inclination to fight or flee, there’s also an element
        of judgement and decision-making involved here.” So, many of the guns could not be used for
        attacking nor self-defense, but were intentionally planned on being used for self defense before
        the fear and circumstances of the plight came into account. This makes the situation better, but
        even so, very few of the guns actually end up being used for self-defense. This justifies the
        previous arguement that guns are not used for self defense very often.</p>
        <p>To alleviate my and millions of other Americans’ fear of gun abuse, the United States can
        continue making laws that restrict who can have the prerogative to own guns and what type of
        guns they can own. Several laws have already been made, but as the statistics demonstrated, they
        are not enough to keep everyone in our country as safe as they could possibly be, which is the
        end goal. To make sure that this fear does not keep me from obtaining my goals, I will educate
        myself on the current laws of gun control and how to be safe in my home, and around guns. I
        could also participate in the many protests going on nationwide. That would be the most
        productive way to deal with my fear.</p>
