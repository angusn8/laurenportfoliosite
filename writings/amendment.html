        <p>The Essential XIII Amendment <br>Lauren Angus</p>
        <p>With the freedom of each equal man and woman comes the most functional way of life, and the most beautiful operation of
        society. A brilliant mind and honest soul, Abraham Lincolin knew this centuries ago. He empathized with the importance
        of the opportunity to live freely and create your own lifestyle, and your own success. He was agonized by the thought of
        the pain- inside and out- that African Americans experienced when they were plauged with the evil that is slavery. For
        these reasons, the United States of America has been free from this evil since December 6th, 1865. For the right of
        opportunity, freedom, and justice to all of mankind, the XIII amendment is of paramount importance to the Constitution
        of the United States, and therefore, should not be repealed.</p>
        <p>Equality & Rights</p>
        <p>Throughout time we have grown further away from prejudice and closer to equality as a nation. Every step in our
        constitution that we have made towards a more equal society has been beneficial and has satisfied more people’s ideals
        than it has disappointed. Thus, the reflection on the American people of these acts has always been positive. Listening
        to this new rebellion group arising to bring back a new “more reasonable” form of slavery will result in detramental
        effects to the country where many people have given their life in the civil war to be free from such effects. It is
        outrageous to think that our way of life once immensely contradicted a fundamental truth that this country was built
        upon. In our very own Declaration of Independence, we claim that “All men are created equal.” Yet the ideals of slavery
        that allow one person to “own” and control another are not founded on this belief. The concept blatantly disrespects
        others right to live a free life. The truth that “All men are created equal” isn’t followed when one person thinks that
        they are better than or entitled to more than another. While slavery was legal in the US, white citizens believed that
        they were superior to african americans meerly because of the color of their skin. Absurdly, it took over a century to
        remove this general outlook form the country. Therefore, now that we have this cancerous and hateful mindset outlawed
        from american society, we must do all that we can to keep it out forever.</p>
        <p>Effects of Slavery Physically & Emotionally</p>
        <p>Though it is of utmost importance, the basic right of equality is not the only factor to consider while arguing against
        slavery. It took a major toll on african american bodies in the 1800’s, physically and mentally. Racism has given
        slaves, and even descendants of slaves, lasting feelings of embarrassment and degradation. The thought alone of feeling
        “owned” or inferior is enough to cause trauma, and when treated poorly in addition (as most were), serious anxiety can
        result. Alma Carten of New York University claims that there is “evidence of a link between perceived racism and adverse
        psychological outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety, depression and other psychiatric symptoms” after being
        exposed to vast amounts of racism. There have even been instances of “Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome” where a slave has
        recurring anxieties of the trauma. A connection between physical abuse and these disorders can be found. Slaves living
        in poor conditions were often faced heavy physical abuse as well as emotional, which ultimately left long lasting
        effects of emotional abuse from both types of abuse.</p>
        <p>What Racism Leads To</p>
        <p>Around the world, bigotry has only brought harm to wherever it is held. In the 1940s, the Holocaust happened in Germany
        and other countries in Europe. It has been estimated that 11 million people died during the Holocaust. These deaths were
        simply because of an extreme hatred and ignorance of another person’s existence. The main group affected by the
        haulocaust were Jews, but millions of people other than those with Jewish heritage were killed and targeted by the
        Nazis. Cruel concentration camps harshly worked, starved, demeaned and slaughtered millions of innocent people.
        Consequently, the Nazis were put on trial in America in the “Nuremberg Trials” for their accounts of murder following
        the Holocaust. It was known that their actions were morally wrong then, in the year 1945, and it has been looked at as
        one of the most horrible occurrences to have taken place ever. The leader of the Nazis, Adolf Hitler, is a universally
        known name for a despicable, evil, and racist human being. In America, it took the sacrifice of 620,000 soldiers in the
        Civil War to outlaw slavery, and the struggle of sacrifice of many others in later years to reverse racism and the Jim
        Crow segregation laws. Every nation has struggled with racism, and America is fortunate to have finally written equality
        in our constitution. If repeal the XIII Amendment, we are opening ourselves up to multiple possibilities for struggle,
        hardship, world destruction, and controversy.</p>
        <p>Rebuttal</p>
        <p>The rebel group supporting slavery and protesting the XIII Amendment argues a different point. They promote slavery for
        the purpose of a better economy. Concerned about the lower production of goods and the weaker economy, they believe that
        using the strongest members of the lower class as slaves will help save our economy. Another concern for them is our
        national debt. So, they want to use 10% of all production from slaves to contribute to the national debt. While our
        economic stance is very important, slavery is not the way to solve this issue due to the overbearing negative effects
        that outweigh it. Furthermore, citizens who aren’t slaves jobs would be taken by slaves, leaving a large part of the
        population either enslaved in harsh conditions, or unemployed.
        
        America knew it when it was abolished and we have known it ever since: slavery is a cancer to society and should be
        outlawed forever. It is of utmost importance to the Constitution for the good of the country. It should never be
        repealed
        under any circumstances, as the basic right of each individual man and woman in the US to be free should be respected
        above all other conflicts to this Amendment</p>
